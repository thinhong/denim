## 1. Simple SIR model with gamma distributed lengths of stay

The SIR model uses 3 compartments: S (susceptible), I (infected), R (recovered) to describe clinical status of individuals. We use the most simple form of SIR model to demonstrate how to define the distribution of the lengths of stay distribution.

<center>

```{r, echo=FALSE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("digraph {
  graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR]
  
  node [shape = rectangle]
  
  S -> I [label = '&#946;SI/N']
  I -> R [label = '&#947;I']
  }",
  width = 300, height = "100%")
```

</center>

The model equations are:

$$S_{t+1} - S_{t} = -\lambda S_{t} = -\frac{\beta I_{t}}{N}S_{t}$$ $$I_{t+1} - I_{t} = \frac{\beta I_{t}}{N}S_{t} - \gamma I_{t}$$ $$R_{t+1} - R_{t} = \gamma I_{t}$$

-   $N$: total population size, $N = S + I + R$
-   $\beta$: the product of contact rates and transmission probability; usually we define $\lambda =\frac{\beta I_{t}}{N}$ as the force of infection
-   $\gamma$: recovery rate

Usually to solve the model more easily we make an assumption that the recovery rate $\gamma$ is constant, this will leads to an exponentially distributed length of stay in the I compartment i.e. most individuals recover after 1 day being infected and a few individuals can stay in this compartment for a very long time.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
rates <- c(0.5, 1, 1.5)
x <- seq(0, 5, 0.001)
y <- dexp(x = x, rate = rates[1])
y2 <- dexp(x = x, rate = rates[2])
y3 <- dexp(x = x, rate = rates[3])

col_codes <- c("#374F77", "#EF9F32", "#6ECBD7")
plot(x, y, type = "l", col = col_codes[1], lty = 1, lwd = 3,
     xlab = "Length of stay (days)", ylab = "density of probability", 
     ylim = c(0, 1.5))
lines(x, y2, col = col_codes[2], lty = 1, lwd = 3)
lines(x, y3, col = col_codes[3], lty = 1, lwd = 3)
legend("topright", legend = paste(c(0.5, 1.0, 1.5), "/day"),
       title = expression(paste("recovery rate ", gamma)),
       col = col_codes, lty = 1, lwd = 3, bty = "n")
```

A more realistic length of stay distribution can look like this, of which most patients recovered after 4 days. We defined this using a gamma distribution with shape = 3 and scale = 2.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x <- seq(0, 20, 0.001)
y <- dgamma(x = x, shape = 3, scale = 2)

plot(x, y, type = "l", col = col_codes[1], lty = 1, lwd = 3,
     xlab = "Length of stay (days)", ylab = "density of probability")
```

The model now look like this:

<center>

```{r, echo=FALSE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("digraph {
  graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR]
  
  node [shape = rectangle]
  
  S -> I [label = '&#946;SI/N']
  I -> R [label = 'd_gamma(3, 2)']
  }",
  width = 400, height = "100%")
```

</center>

**Model specification**

*Model transition*

<center>

```{r, echo=FALSE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("digraph {
  graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR]
  
  node [shape = rectangle]
  
  S -> I [label = '&#946;SI/N']
  I -> R [label = 'd_gamma(3, 2)']
  }",
  width = 400, height = "100%")
```

</center>

We have two transitions `S -> I` and `I -> R` in this case. The transitions are specified in a list follow this format `"transition" = equation`, of which equation is defined with one of our functions for waiting time distribution.

```{r}
transitions <- list(
  "S -> I" = "beta * S * I / N",
  "I -> R" = d_gamma(3, 2)
)
```

*Initial state*

Use a vector to define the compartments with their assigned names and initial values in the format `compartment_name = initial_value`:

```{r}
initialValues <- c(
  S = 999, 
  I = 1, 
  R = 0
)
```

*Model parameters*

If we use a math expression, any symbols except the compartment names are parameters, and would be defined by constant values. There are two constant parameters in our example: `beta` and `N`:

```{r}
parameters <- c(
  beta = 0.012,
  N = 1000
)
```

**Model application**

*Time step specification*

We run the model for 30 days and give output at 0.01 daily intervals. The default interval (time step) is 1 if not declared explicitly.

```{r}
simulationDuration <- 30
timeStep <- 0.01
```

```{r, fig.width = 6}
mod <- sim(transitions = transitions, 
           initialValues = initialValues, 
           parameters = parameters, 
           simulationDuration = simulationDuration, 
           timeStep = timeStep)
head(mod)
plot(mod)
```

## 2. How the algorithm work?

In the SIR model, all infected individuals are presented by a single compartment I and have the same recovery rate $\gamma$.

<center>

```{r, echo=FALSE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("digraph {
  graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR]
  
  node [shape = rectangle]
  
  S -> I [label = '&#946;SI/N']
  I -> R [label = '&#947;I']
  }",
  width = 300, height = "100%")
```

</center>

We want the recovery rate of individuals who had been infected for 1 day differ from the recovery rate of 2-day infected patients. So rather than using one compartment for infected (I), we define multiple infected sub-compartments. The number of sub-compartments depends on the maximum day we expect all infected individuals would be recovered.

For example, if we expect a disease with a maximum 4 days of infection, we will end up with 4 sub-compartments. Each sub-compartment has its own recovery rate $\gamma_{1}$, $\gamma_{2}$, $\gamma_{3}$, $\gamma_{4}$. At day 4 it is certain that the patient will recover (because we assume that this disease has a maximum 4 days of infection), $\gamma_{4} = 1$. Note that the initial population is always assigned to the first compartment (for example, if the initial value for I compartment is `I = 1`, denim will initialize `I1 = 1` while `I2 = I3 = I4 = 0`).

<center>

```{r, echo=FALSE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("digraph {
  graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR]
  
  node [shape = rectangle]
  
  S -> I1 [label = '&#946;S(I@_{1} + I@_{2} + I@_{3} + I@_{4})/N']
  I1 -> R1 [label = '&#947;@_{1}I@_{1}']
  I2 -> R2 [label = '&#947;@_{2}I@_{2}']
  I3 -> R3 [label = '&#947;@_{3}I@_{3}']
  I4 -> R4 [label = 'I@_{4}']
  I1 -> I2 [label = '(1-&#947;@_{1})I@_{1}']
  I2 -> I3 [label = '(1-&#947;@_{2})I@_{2}']
  I3 -> I4 [label = '(1-&#947;@_{3})I@_{3}']
  }", height = "100%", width = "100%")
```

</center>

Let $R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + R_4 = \Sigma R$. We have $\frac{R_1}{\Sigma R} = p_1$, $\frac{R_2}{\Sigma R} = p_2$, $\frac{R_3}{\Sigma R} = p_3$, $\frac{R_4}{\Sigma R} = p_4$. Our mission is to estimate $\gamma_{1}$, $\gamma_{2}$, $\gamma_{3}$ to obtain $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$, $p_4$ that fit a pre-defined distribution at the equilibrium state. This can be obtained by setting:

$$\gamma_{i} = \frac{p_i}{1 - \sum_{j=1}^{i-1}p_j}$$

For a given length of stay distribution, we identify the maximum length of stay using its cumulative distribution function. Because cumulative distribution function is asymptotic to 1 and never equal to 1, we need to set a value that is acceptable to be rounded to 1. If we want a cumulative probability of 0.999 to be rounded as 1, we set the error tolerance threshold as `1 - 0.999 = 0.001` (specified by the argument `errorTolerance = 0.001`). The time when cumulative probability = 0.999 will be set as the maximum length of stay of the compartment. Default `errorTolerance` of `denim` is set at `0.001`.

## 3. Waiting time distribution

The distributions currently available in this package are:

-   `d_exponential(rate)`: Discrete **exponential distribution** with parameter `rate`

-   `d_gamma(scale, shape)`: Discrete **gamma distribution** with parameters `scale` and `shape`

-   `d_weibull(scale, shape)`: Discrete **Weibull distribution** with parameters `scale` and `shape`

-   `d_lognormal(mu, sigma)`: Discrete **log-normal distribution** with parameters `mu` and `sigma`

You can define other type of transitions such as:

-   Mathematical expression: Transition defined with a string value such as `"beta * S * I / N"` will be converted to a mathematical expression. You will need to define parameters that are not compartment names in the `parameters` argument

-   Constant: Transition defined with a numerical value such as `1`, `2` will be converted to a constant. This is to define the number of individuals moving in a time step.

-   `transprob(x)`: Every time step a **fixed percentage** of the left compartment transit to the right compartment, this is also a convenient way to define $R_t - R_{t-1} = \gamma I$ which we can input `"I -> R" = transprob(gamma)`

-   `nonparametric(waitingTimes...)`: A **vector of values**, could be numbers, percentages, density of the length of stay based on real data, `denim` will convert it into a distribution

-   `multinomial(probabilities)`: A convenient way to define **several probabilities** of a compartment transit to many compartments, may or may not in a time step. For example, `"V -> VA, VS, VH" = multinomial(0.6, 0.3, 0.1)` means 60% of `V` will become `VA`, 30% become `VS` and 10% become `VH`. If we continue to define the length of stay distribution for these transitions e.g `"V -> VA" = d_gamma(3, 2)`, probabilities defined with `multinomial()` is not the percentage of the left compartment transit in each time step, but the percentage of individuals move to `VA` at the equilibrium state. If we do not define further length of stay distribution, `"V -> VA, VS, VH" = multinomial(0.6, 0.3, 0.1)` is the percentage of `V` transit to the right compartments per time step similar to a `transprob()` function. See more detailed explanations in the ***Multiple transitions from a compartment*** section.

## 4. Multiple transitions from a compartment

We have many ways to define the type of transition when there are two or more transitions from a compartment. Consider this example:

<center>

```{r, echo=FALSE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("digraph {
  graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR]
  
  node [shape = rectangle]
  
  S -> I [label = '&#946;SI/N']
  S -> V [label = '5']
  I -> R [label = '0.9 -> d_gamma(3, 2)']
  I -> D [label = '0.1 -> d_lognormal(2, 0.5)']
  }",
  width = 500, height = "100%")
```

</center>

There are two scenarios in this example:

-   Susceptible individuals can be infected or vaccinated. The assumption here is they will be infected first (`S -> I`), and then the rest of them who were not infected will get vaccinated (`S -> V`).

-   Infected individuals can recover or die. If the mortality probability is known, we can implement it into the model, for example by defining `0.9 * I -> R` (90% individuals will recover) and then `0.1 * I -> D` (10% of them die). By doing so, we ensure that the mortality probability is 10%, while also define the length of stay of individuals at the infected state before recover or die follows gamma or log-normal distribution, respectively.

We can define the model for this example as follows:

```{r, fig.width = 5}
transitions <- list(
  "S -> I" = "beta * S * I / N",
  "S -> V" = 7,
  "0.9 * I -> R" = d_gamma(3, 2),
  "0.1 * I -> D" = d_lognormal(2, 0.5)
)

initialValues <- c(
  S = 999, 
  I = 1, 
  R = 0,
  V = 0,
  D = 0
)

parameters <- c(
  beta = 0.12,
  N = 1000
)

simulationDuration <- 10
timeStep <- 0.01

mod <- sim(transitions = transitions, 
           initialValues = initialValues, 
           parameters = parameters, 
           simulationDuration = simulationDuration, 
           timeStep = timeStep)
plot(mod)
```

**Tips**: Instead of writing:

```         
"0.9 * I -> R" = d_gamma(3, 2),
"0.1 * I -> D" = d_lognormal(2, 0.5)
```

You can also use the `multinomial()`, then define the length of stay distribution and obtain the same result:

```         
"I -> R, D" = multinomial(0.9, 0.1),
"I -> R" = d_gamma(3, 2),
"I -> D" = d_lognormal(2, 0.5)
```

## 5. Another example

  graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR]
  
  node [shape = rectangle]
  
  S -> I [label = '&#946;S(I + IV)/N']
  S -> V [label = '2']
  I -> D [label = '0.1 -> d_lognormal(2, 0.5)']
  I -> R [label = '0.9 -> d_gamma(3, 2)']
  V -> IV [label = '0.1 * &#946;V(I + IV)/N']
  IV -> R [label = 'd_exponential(2)']
  }",
  width = 700, height = "100%")

)

simulationDuration <- 10
timeStep <- 0.01

mod <- sim(transitions = transitions, 
           initialValues = initialValues, 
           parameters = parameters, 
           simulationDuration = simulationDuration, 
           timeStep = timeStep)
plot(mod)
```

```{r}
transitions <- list(
  "O -> S" = 100,
  "S -> I, R" = multinomial(0.5, 0.5),
  "S -> I" = transprob(1),

)

initialValues <- c(
  O = 1000,
  S = 500, 
  I = 0, 
  R = 0
)

simulationDuration <- 10
timeStep <- 0.01

mod <- sim(transitions = transitions, 
           initialValues = initialValues, 
           parameters = parameters, 
           simulationDuration = simulationDuration, 
           timeStep = timeStep)
head(mod)
```
